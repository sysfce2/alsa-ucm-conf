# MOTU 828 (28x32), released in 2024, Factory Defaults
# This is how the MOTU 828 initially appears in its included CueMix5 software for Mac OSX and Windows

# ***** Still needs to be done*****:
# 1)  ADAT mode for banks A & B of optical ports (8ch each in + out, each bank).  Removed these for now, as the macro only supports 2 channel parameters
# 2)  Related:  a conflict switch for optical Bank A between 2-channel TOSLink and 8-channel ADAT
# 3)  Surround mapping (eg. 7.1 configuration, like 0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9 map to FL,FR,FC,LFE,SL,SR,RL,RR respectively
# 4)  Headphone mixdown + surround, so line outs play surround, while headphones mixdown surround to stereo



#----------------------
#---This section uses the referenced macro for the device configuration---:
# While the MOTU 828 can support mono outputs, I do not foresee ever needing this in practical usage.  It can be added in the future if necessary.
